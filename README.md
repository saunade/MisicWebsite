This project was created with a focus on learning how to work with the sprint cycle,
I and 4 other students created this website within a week, completing user stories that we added to our sprint backlog
Specifically, I worked on the pages relating treasurer: Finances.html, MemberTable.html, Treasurer.html, UpcomingPractices.html
I also connected the webpages to MongoDB in server.js where I created the schema and set up the connection

if you want to view the files, first follow the command lines below to properly setup the node package files

npm init

npm i express mongoose ejs

nodemon server.js

now the website should be running at localhost:3000
